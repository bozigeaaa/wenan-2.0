## wenan 中文 B2B 模式

This project-local copy vendors upstream Humanizer 2.11.2 from https://github.com/blader/humanizer and adds the following wenan constraints. 项目规则优先于上游通用规则；未被本节覆盖的上游 35 类模式继续适用。

## 适用场景

- 用户提供已有文案并要求更自然、更口语化、去 AI 味、别太书面或更像短视频口播时，也使用本 Skill。
- 本 Skill 负责表达层重构，不负责新闻核验、标题方向、产品选择、公司露出、法规判断、资料选择或分镜。
- 完整口播稿都按 `expression-craft.md` 做口语验收；口语不足或问句过密本身就是必须重写的症状。标题、方向或分镜任务不触发本 Skill。
- Humanizer 不替代事实核验。项目流程是否进入改写由上游事实门决定；用户直接稿含数字、法规、案例、公司能力、新闻或强因果等高风险主张时，先标记并核验，高风险项未通过前只做诊断，不输出可直接发布的改写稿。普通低风险表达调整不因此增加额外门槛。
- wenan 项目口播还要读取 `.agents/skills/references/expression-craft.md`；本 Skill 独立调用时，也不得以“没有新事实”作为删除过渡的充分理由。

### 两类输入与事实状态

**项目流程稿：** 只有调用方明确说明已经通过事实门，或交付了可追溯的锁定事实清单时，才把相应事实视为已核实。锁定项包括事实命题、数字、日期、参数、法规表述、案例、新闻主体、比较对象、必要限定、因果强度、适用范围、责任关系、公司能力边界和 `资料出处`。

**用户直接稿：** 用户直接提供或粘贴的内容只视为待审文本，不得自动视为已核实。先标记实质性主张；明显缺来源的高风险事实不得在保持原强度的同时被润色得更自然、更可信，也不能靠降调冒充核实。完成核验前，只返回表达诊断、事实风险和最小阻断信息；低风险表达可在不触碰这些主张的范围内处理。

两类输入都遵守：

- 事实命题、限定条件、因果强度和责任关系是改写不变量。
- 不得新增、删除、弱化或强化实质性事实，不把“可能／需确认”改成“一定／已经发生”。
- 严格保持条件、例外、比较口径、先后依赖、因果强度和责任主体。
- 不为增加个性补写观点、反应、现场感、客户反馈、项目结果、竞品缺陷或效果承诺。
- 可以删除重复脚手架、空泛暖场、无信息过渡和重复总结，但只能删除不承载新事实的部分。
- 不承载新事实不等于“无信息过渡”。能标明条件变化、指代对象、因果或责任关系，或能防止朗读跳跃的功能性过渡应保留、合并或改写，不能因它本身没有新专业知识而删除。
- 可以重排句子和重排段落，也可以合并或拆分段落；重排后不得改变前因后果、时间顺序、条件作用域或责任归属。
- 上游内容选择有问题时返回上游处理；Humanizer 不重新选钩子角度、产品、植入策略或正文观点；可以按表达标准补足已授权的动作结尾。
- 不固定正文结构；结构由事实之间的真实关系决定。

### 症状式口播审查

完整稿必须读取 `.agents/skills/references/expression-craft.md`，逐项检查直接对话、句长、口语密度、反问和设问、书面连接词、新闻背景与动作结尾。项目口语标准优先于下方上游对填充词、正式词、短句和结尾的通用处理；不得将符合标准的口语词或互动结尾重新删掉。

只重写出现症状的句子或段落；不达口语标准、报告式列举、连续概念辨析、反问和中段自问自答都属于症状。已经符合标准的部分保留，跨段生硬时可重组整稿。不能只换几个同义词交差。

重写后按同一表达标准复查，并逐项核对事实命题、限定条件、因果强度和责任关系。

### 中文标点与文风

- 上游关于英文标题大小写、英文连字符、英语 `is/are`、`-ing`、直引号及破折号的规则只适用于英文文本。
- 中文稿保留自然的中文引号、标点和停顿；不得为了套用英文规则破坏中文表达。
- 用户提供 2–3 段已发布口播样本时，可以匹配句长、常用词、停顿、分行和标点。样本只影响表达，不覆盖事实、专业和合规边界。

### 开篇钩子

- Humanizer 只在钩子存在朗读症状时调整表达；不符合 `expression-craft.md` 的直接对话或问句要求也视为症状，不重新选择角度。必须保留其核心内容，并确保悬念由后文解答。
- 不能补造新闻、现场、客户反馈、数字或结果。
- 第一句可以先设置悬念，最迟在第二句话明确行业对象、目标受众或具体场景。

### wenan 输出方式

本节在 wenan 项目中覆盖下方上游 `How to return the result` 的默认展示方式。

- 作为 wenan 完整文案流程的内部步骤时，只把审查后的最终文案返回给调用方；没有明确症状时原样通过，不为制造改动另写一版。
- 用户直接要求优化已有文案时，先按上述输入类型判断事实状态。高风险主张完成核验后，默认只交付一份最终稿；用户明确要求对照时才同时展示原稿。未能核验时只交付诊断或阻断说明，不用免责声明包装一份看似可发布的改写稿。
- 最终稿必须来自同一份输入，不得为了制造差异重新选题、增加观点或生成另一篇稿。
- wenan 完整文案流程中的初稿从第一句起按“对着镜头说话”生成；本 Skill 只修复审查发现的症状，可以重组句子、段落和信息顺序，也可以删除不承载事实的重复脚手架。

# Humanizer: remove AI writing patterns

Rewrite AI-sounding text so it reads like the writer, not a chatbot. Do not change what it says or make up details.

The patterns below come from Wikipedia's ["Signs of AI writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup.

## What to do

When given text to humanize:

1. **Find AI patterns.** Check the text against the patterns below.
2. **Keep every claim.** You may shorten dull parts, expand useful parts, and merge or split paragraphs. Keep the information even when you change the structure.
3. **Do not invent facts.** Do not add a fact, name, number, date, quote, or citation unless it comes from the source or the user. If a sentence needs a missing detail, ask for it or use a simpler sentence. You may add an opinion or reaction when the writer's voice calls for one, but you may not add a factual claim. Fiction is exempt because invented details are part of the task.
4. **Match the voice.** Use the right tone for the text, such as formal, casual, or technical. Add personality only when the text and the writer call for it.

The input type controls what you return. See [How to return the result](#how-to-return-the-result). Use the same rewrite process in every mode.

## Match the writer's voice

If the user provides a writing sample (their own previous writing), analyze it before rewriting:

1. Read the sample first. Note its sentence length, word choice, paragraph openings, punctuation, repeated phrases, and transitions.
2. Match those habits. Do not replace casual words with formal ones or remove deliberate quirks.
3. If there is no sample, use the guidance below.

A writing sample takes priority over these style rules. If the sample uses em dashes, keep them at about the same rate. Do not apply §14 as a ban.

## Add personality only when it fits

Removing AI patterns is only half the job. The result should still sound like a person.

Use personality in blog posts, essays, opinions, and personal writing when it fits the writer. Keep reference, technical, legal, and factual text neutral. Do not add opinions or first-person language where they do not belong.

When personality fits, keep the writer's opinions, uncertainty, mixed feelings, humor, asides, and uneven rhythm. Never invent facts to make the text feel personal.

## Content patterns

### 1. Inflated claims about importance and legacy

**Words to watch:** stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting, contributing to the, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the, represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, focal point, indelible mark, deeply rooted
**Problem:** AI writing often claims that ordinary details mark a major change, prove a legacy, or reflect a broad trend.
**Before:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.
**After:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989, part of a wider decentralization of administrative functions in Spain.

### 2. Name-dropping to prove importance

**Words to watch:** independent coverage, local/regional/national media outlets, written by a leading expert, active social media presence
**Problem:** AI writing often lists well-known publications or follower counts to prove that a person matters. The list usually gives no useful context.
**Before:**
> Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu. She maintains an active social media presence with over 500,000 followers.
**After:**
> Her views have been cited in The New York Times and the BBC.

If the source explains what the person said and where, keep that useful citation. Do not invent context for a shorter version.

### 3. Shallow analysis with -ing phrases

**Words to watch:** highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing..., ensuring..., reflecting/symbolizing..., contributing to..., cultivating/fostering..., encompassing..., showcasing...
**Problem:** AI writing often adds an -ing phrase to make a simple fact sound deeper than it is.
**Before:**
> The temple's color palette of blue, green, and gold resonates with the region's natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the diverse Texan landscapes, reflecting the community's deep connection to the land.
**After:**
> The temple is painted blue, green, and gold, colors meant to evoke Texas bluebonnets and the Gulf of Mexico.

### 4. Sales language

**Words to watch:** boasts a, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, enhancing its, showcasing, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning
**Problem:** AI writing often sounds like an advertisement, especially when it describes places, culture, products, or organizations.
**Before:**
> Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.
**After:**
> Alamata Raya Kobo is a town in the Gonder region of Ethiopia.

### 5. Vague sources

**Words to watch:** Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources/publications (when few cited)
**Problem:** AI writing often assigns a claim to unnamed experts, critics, reports, or observers.
**Before:**
> Due to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Experts believe it plays a crucial role in the regional ecosystem.
**After:**
> Researchers and conservationists study the Haolai River for its unusual characteristics.

Name a real source when the source text provides one. Otherwise, remove the unsupported claim. Never invent a source.

### 6. Formulaic challenges and outlook sections

**Words to watch:** Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook
**Problem:** AI articles often add a stock section about challenges, future prospects, or continued growth. These sections usually repeat vague claims instead of adding facts.
**Before:**
> Despite its industrial prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including traffic congestion and water scarcity. Despite these challenges, with its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of Chennai's growth.
**After:**
> Korattur has recurring traffic congestion and water shortages.

Add details such as dates or public actions only when they come from the source or the user.

## Language and grammar patterns

### 7. Overused AI words

**High-frequency AI words:** Actually, additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, gate/gated/gating (figurative; preserve established technical usage), highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), pivotal, quietly, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant
**Problem:** AI writing uses these words much more often than most people do, especially in groups.
**Before:**
> Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali cuisine is the incorporation of camel meat. An enduring testament to Italian colonial influence is the widespread adoption of pasta in the local culinary landscape, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet.
**After:**
> Somali cuisine also includes camel meat, which is considered a delicacy. Pasta dishes, introduced during Italian colonization, remain common, especially in the south.

### 8. Avoiding is and are

**Words to watch:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers [a]
**Problem:** AI writing often replaces simple verbs such as *is*, *are*, and *has* with longer phrases.
**Before:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.
**After:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet.

### 9. Not X but Y and clipped negative endings
**Problem:** AI writing overuses forms such as "Not only...but..." and "It's not just X, it's Y."

It also adds clipped endings such as "no guessing" instead of writing a clear clause.
**Before:**
> It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere. It's not merely a song, it's a statement.
**After:**
> The heavy beat adds to the aggressive tone.
**Before (tailing negation):**
> The options come from the selected item, no guessing.
**After:**
> The options come from the selected item without forcing the user to guess.

### 10. Forced groups of three
**Problem:** AI writing often forces ideas into groups of three to sound complete.
**Before:**
> The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.
**After:**
> The event includes talks and panels. There's also time for informal networking between sessions.

### 11. Changing names and repeating sentence openings
**Problem:** AI writing handles repetition by rule instead of by ear. It may keep renaming the same person or thing. It may also start several sentences with the same subject, often *she* or *he*.

Use one clear name for the same subject. For repeated openings, merge sentences, change the subject when that helps, or begin with the action.
**Before (synonym cycling):**
> The protagonist faces many challenges. The main character must overcome obstacles. The central figure eventually triumphs. The hero returns home.
**After:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges but eventually triumphs and returns home.
**Before (repeated openings):**
> She noted the door. She noted the lock on it. She filed both away.
**After:**
> She noted the door and its lock, then filed both away.

Do not ban the repeated word. Fix the repeated sentence pattern. The remaining sentence may still start with "She."

### 12. False from X to Y ranges
**Problem:** AI writing often uses "from X to Y" when X and Y do not form a real range.
**Before:**
> Our journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars to the enigmatic dance of dark matter.
**After:**
> The book covers the Big Bang, star formation, and current theories about dark matter.

### 13. Passive voice and missing subjects
**Problem:** AI writing often hides who acts or drops the subject. Use active voice when it makes the actor and action clearer.
**Before:**
> No configuration file needed. The results are preserved automatically.
**After:**
> You do not need a configuration file. The system preserves the results automatically.

## Style patterns

### 14. Em and en dashes

**Rule:** The final rewrite must not contain em dashes (—) or en dashes (–), unless the writer's sample uses them. Replace a dash with a period, comma, colon, or parentheses, or rewrite the sentence. Also check for spaced dashes (` — `) and double hyphens (` -- `) used as dashes.
**Before:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions—not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address—yet this mislabeling continues—even in official documents.
**After:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address, yet this mislabeling continues in official documents.
**Before:**
> The new policy — announced without warning — affects thousands of workers. The changes -- long overdue according to critics -- will take effect immediately.
**After:**
> The new policy, announced without warning, affects thousands of workers. The changes, long overdue according to critics, will take effect immediately.

Before returning the rewrite, search for `—` and `–`. Remove each one unless the writer's sample uses that mark. In that case, match the sample's rate.

### 15. Too much bold text
**Problem:** AI chatbots often bold words and phrases without a clear reason.
**Before:**
> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**.
**After:**
> It blends OKRs, KPIs, and visual strategy tools like the Business Model Canvas and Balanced Scorecard.

### 16. Lists with bold mini-headings
**Problem:** AI writing often uses vertical lists in which every item starts with a bold label and a colon.
**Before:**
> - **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
> - **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
> - **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.
**After:**
> The update improves the interface, speeds up load times through optimized algorithms, and adds end-to-end encryption.

### 17. Title case in headings
**Problem:** AI chatbots often capitalize every main word in a heading.
**Before:**
> ## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships
**After:**
> ## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships

### 18. Emojis
**Problem:** AI chatbots often add emojis to headings and list items as decoration.
**Before:**
> 🚀 **Launch Phase:** The product launches in Q3
> 💡 **Key Insight:** Users prefer simplicity
> ✅ **Next Steps:** Schedule follow-up meeting
**After:**
> The product launches in Q3. User research showed a preference for simplicity. Next step: schedule a follow-up meeting.

### 19. Curly quotation marks
**Problem:** ChatGPT often uses curly quotes (“...”) where the writer or target format uses straight quotes ("...").
**Before:**
> He said “the project is on track” but others disagreed.
**After:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.

## Chatbot patterns

### 20. Chatbot text left in the answer

**Words to watch:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., Want me to...?, Want me to give examples?, Should I continue?, let me know, here is a...
**Problem:** A chatbot's greeting, offer, or closing sometimes remains in text that should stand on its own.
**Before:**
> Here is an overview of the French Revolution. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.
**After:**
> The French Revolution began in 1789 when financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest.

### 21. Knowledge-limit disclaimers and guesses

**Words to watch:** as of [date], Up to my last training update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., based on available information, not publicly available, maintains a low profile, keeps personal details private, prefers to stay out of the spotlight, likely [grew up/studied/began], it is believed that
**Problem:** Older models may mention the date when their knowledge ends. A model may also explain that it could not find a source, then fill the gap with a plausible guess. State what the source does not show, or remove the sentence. Do not present a guess as a fact.
**Before (cutoff disclaimer):**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.
**After:**
> The company's founding date is not documented in the available sources. (Or cut the sentence. State a date only if a source provides one.)
**Before (speculative gap-fill):**
> Information about her early life is not publicly available, suggesting she maintains a low profile and keeps personal details private. She likely grew up in a middle-class household, which shaped her later interest in education reform.
**After:**
> Her early life is not documented in the available sources. (Or omit the section.)

### 22. Overly agreeable tone
**Problem:** AI assistants often praise the user or agree before giving the answer.
**Before:**
> Great question! You're absolutely right that this is a complex topic. That's an excellent point about the economic factors.
**After:**
> The economic factors you mentioned are relevant here.

## Filler and hedging

### 23. Filler phrases

**Before → After:**
- "In order to achieve this goal" → "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that it was raining" → "Because it was raining"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "In the event that you need help" → "If you need help"
- "The system has the ability to process" → "The system can process"
- "It is important to note that the data shows" → "The data shows"

### 24. Too many qualifiers

**Phrases to watch:** to be fair, it's also possible, could potentially, might arguably, in some cases it may, this is an inference
**Problem:** Repeated editing can add one qualifier after another until every claim sounds uncertain. Keep a qualifier only when the source supports it and the meaning needs it. Remove caveats that only repair an earlier overstatement.
**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.
**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.

### 25. Generic positive endings
**Problem:** AI writing often ends with vague optimism instead of the last useful fact.
**Before:**
> The future looks bright for the company. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence. This represents a major step in the right direction.
**After:**
> (Cut the paragraph. End on the last concrete fact instead of a send-off. If the source states real plans, use those.)

### 26. Too many hyphenated word pairs

**Words to watch:** third-party, cross-functional, client-facing, data-driven, decision-making, well-known, high-quality, real-time, long-term, end-to-end
**Problem:** AI writing often hyphenates these pairs everywhere. Keep the hyphen before a noun when grammar needs it, as in `a high-quality report`. Drop it after the noun, as in `the report is high quality`.
**Before:**
> The cross-functional team delivered a high-quality, data-driven report. The team is cross-functional, the report is high-quality, and the methodology is data-driven.
**After:**
> The cross-functional team delivered a high-quality, data-driven report. The team is cross functional, the report is high quality, and the methodology is data driven.

### 27. Pretending to reveal a deeper truth

**Phrases to watch:** The real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter
**Problem:** AI writing uses these phrases to make an ordinary point sound like a hidden truth.
**Before:**
> The real question is whether teams can adapt. At its core, what really matters is organizational readiness.
**After:**
> The question is whether teams can adapt. That mostly depends on whether the organization is ready to change its habits.

### 28. Announcing the next point

**Phrases to watch:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado, heads up, quick note, before I forget
**Problem:** AI writing often announces the next point instead of stating it. A casual phrase such as "one thing that bit me" can have the same problem. Remove the announcement, not just its formal tone.
**Before:**
> Let's dive into how caching works in Next.js. Here's what you need to know.
**After:**
> Next.js caches data at multiple layers, including request memoization, the data cache, and the router cache.
**Before (casual register):**
> One thing that bit me hard, so pay attention to this part: the webpack dev server doesn't send the CORS header by default.
**After:**
> The webpack dev server doesn't send the CORS header by default.

### 29. A heading repeated in the first sentence

**Signs to watch:** A heading followed by a one-line paragraph that simply restates the heading before the real content begins.
**Problem:** AI writing often follows a heading with a sentence that only repeats the heading. Remove the repeated sentence.
**Before:**
> ## Performance
>
> Speed matters.
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.
**After:**
> ## Performance
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

### 30. Writing about the previous version
**Problem:** Documentation and comments should describe the current behavior. Mention the previous version only in change logs, release notes, migration guides, and other documents about change.
**Before:**
> This function was added to replace the previous approach of iterating through all items, which caused O(n²) performance.
**After:**
> This function uses a hash map for O(1) lookups, avoiding the O(n²) cost of naive iteration.

### 31. Forced punchlines and dramatic fragments
**Problem:** AI writing often turns each sentence into a dramatic closing line. One short sentence can add emphasis. A row of short fragments usually feels forced.
**Before:**
> Then AlphaEvolve arrived. It had no preference for symmetry. No aesthetic prior. No nostalgia for human taste. The old rules were gone.
**After:**
> AlphaEvolve changed the search because it did not favor symmetry or human-looking designs. That made some of the older assumptions less useful.

### 32. Formulaic sayings

**Words to watch:** X is the Y of Z, X becomes a trap, X is not a tool but a mirror, the language of, the currency of, the architecture of
**Problem:** AI writing often turns an ordinary claim into a saying that sounds deep but adds no detail. Replace the saying with the specific claim.
**Before:**
> Symmetry is the language of trust. Efficiency becomes a trap when teams forget the human layer.
**After:**
> Symmetric layouts often feel more predictable to users. Teams can over-optimize workflows and miss how people actually use them.

### 33. Fake-candid openings

**Phrases to watch:** Honestly?, Look, Here's the thing, The thing is, Let's be honest, Real talk, when used as standalone hooks or fake-candid pauses before an ordinary point.
**Problem:** AI writing often starts with a staged pause or claim of honesty before making a routine point. State the point directly.
**Before:**
> Is it worth the price? Honestly? It depends on how often you'll use it.
**After:**
> Whether it's worth the price depends on how often you'll use it.

### 34. Answering objections no one raised

**Phrases to watch:** This isn't (mainly/really) about, I'm not saying/arguing/trying to, To be clear, Don't get me wrong, This is not to say, You could argue/frame this differently but, Some might say... but
**Problem:** AI writing may answer an objection that does not appear in the text. Watch for an unattributed statement about what the writer does not mean, especially when the topic appears nowhere else. A direct claim such as "the API is not thread-safe" is not this pattern.
**Before:**
> This isn't mainly about prompt length, and I'm not arguing that documentation doesn't matter. You could categorize the problem another way, but the issue is whether the agent can use the instruction when it acts.
**After:**
> The issue is whether the agent can use the instruction when it acts.

Remove only the unsupported defense. If it contains a real claim, state that claim directly. Keep an objection when the text names its source or answers it in full.

### 35. Rejecting fake alternatives

**Phrases to watch:** A tempting option/approach would be, One might be tempted to, An obvious approach would be, You might think... but, It would be easy to just, Some would suggest
**Problem:** AI writing may introduce an option that no reader would consider, reject it in a clause, and never mention it again. This often leaves an old drafting idea in the final text. Remove the fake option and state the real constraint directly.
**Before:**
> Session tokens are rotated every 24 hours. A tempting approach would be to rotate them by restarting the auth service on a cron job, but that would drop every active session. Rotation happens in place, and clients refresh transparently.
**After:**
> Session tokens are rotated every 24 hours, in place, and clients refresh transparently.

One rejected option may be valid. Several short, unrelated rejections are a stronger sign. Ask what new information each sentence adds. If it only records an earlier edit, rewrite the paragraph around its main point.

## Check for false positives

### What not to flag

A person may use some of these patterns. Do not treat any item below as proof by itself:

- **Perfect grammar and consistent style.** Many writers are professionals or have been edited. Polish does not equal AI.
- **Mixed casual and formal styles.** This can reflect the writer's field, age, or personal habits.
- **"Bland" or "robotic" prose.** AI prose has *specific* tells. Generic dryness without those tells is just dry writing.
- **Formal or academic words.** §7 lists specific words that AI writing overuses. Do not simplify every formal word.
- **Letter-style opening or closing on a comment.** Salutations and sign-offs predate ChatGPT by centuries.
- **Common transition words in isolation.** *Additionally*, *moreover*, *consequently* are AI-coded only when piled up. One *however* is not a tell.
- **Curly quotes alone.** macOS, Word, Google Docs, and most CMSes auto-curl by default. Curly quotes only count when stacked with other tells.
- **Em dashes alone.** Many editors and journalists use them often. Em dashes are evidence only when paired with formulaic sales-y rhythm.
- **One short sentence for emphasis.** Flag dramatic fragments only when several appear in a row.
- **Deliberate repeated openings.** Writers may repeat an opening to build rhythm or pressure, as in "She came. She saw. She conquered." Change it only when the repetition adds nothing.
- **"Honestly" or "look" mid-sentence.** These are ordinary in casual writing. The tell is the standalone theatrical opener, not the word itself.
- **Useful limits and disclaimers.** Keep scope statements, legal and safety notices, real corrections, named objections, replies, and FAQ answers.
- **Real alternatives.** Keep options that a reader may consider in a design document, tutorial, or argument. Remove only an unlikely option that the text dismisses and never uses again.
- **Unsourced claims.** Most of the web is unsourced. Lack of citations doesn't prove anything.
- **Correct, complex formatting.** Visual editors and templates produce clean output without any AI.
- **Secondhand text.** Do not rewrite watched phrases inside quotations, titles, proper names, or examples where the phrase is being discussed rather than used.

When unsure, look for several patterns together. One em dash proves nothing. Several stock patterns in the same passage are stronger evidence.

### Human details to keep

These details often carry the writer's voice. Keep them unless they hurt the meaning:

- **Specific, unusual details.** Keep a real address, an odd quote, or a phrase such as "the lawyer who used to work upstairs from my dentist."
- **Mixed feelings and unresolved tension.** Keep lines such as "I think this is mostly good, but it bothers me, and I can't fully explain why."
- **Dated, era-bound references.** Slang, memes, or in-jokes that map to a specific year and subculture. Models lag by a year or more.
- **Deliberate first-person choices.** Keep a cut or word choice when the writer can explain why it belongs.
- **Variety in sentence length.** Real writing alternates short and long. AI writing tends toward an even, mid-length cadence.
- **Genuine asides, parentheticals, or self-corrections.** "(I keep wanting to say 'almost' here, but it really was certain.)" Models rarely interrupt themselves like this.
- **Edits made before November 30, 2022.** ChatGPT's public launch. Anything older than that is, with very rare exceptions, not AI-written.

## How to return the result

**Pasted text (default).** Return the draft, a short list of remaining AI patterns, and the final rewrite.

**File mode.** When the user names a file, run the full rewrite process but write only the final text to the file. Change prose only. Keep code blocks, YAML metadata, data, and link targets unchanged. Then give the user a short summary.

**Embedded mode.** When another task uses this skill for a pull request, commit message, or document, return only the final text.

## Rewrite process

1. Read the source and mark each AI pattern.
2. Write a draft. Read it aloud. Check the rhythm, details, simple verbs such as *is* and *has*, and the right level of formality.
3. Check the draft for remaining AI patterns and compare it with the source. Any unsupported addition or lost fact, name, number, date, quote, citation, ranking, or other claim is an error. In wenan mode, keep this check internal and do not turn it into a user-facing question or prerequisite.
4. Write the final version. State each point naturally instead of patching one flagged phrase at a time. If a sentence stays awkward, rewrite the paragraph around its main point. Apply the dash rule in §14.

## Source

This skill is based on [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. Its patterns come from reviews of AI-generated text on Wikipedia.

Wikipedia's main point: "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."
